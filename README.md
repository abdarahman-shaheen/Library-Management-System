# Library-Management-System
Build a RESTful API for a Library Management System using .NET Minimal APIs, SQL Server as the database, and Entity Framework for ORM. The application should allow users to manage books, authors, and borrowers, and track book loans. The goal is to practice SQL relationships, SOLID principles, and OOP concepts.
